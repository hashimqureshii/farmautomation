# farmautomation
This project is about automating everyday tasks on a farm like irrigation.
It deals with two of such tasks. 
First one is detection of soil moisture to schedule irrigation. 
Second is light intensity detection to provide appropriate light to plants for optimum growth.
Two corresponding sensors have been interfaced with qn ESP-32 to manage these activities.
